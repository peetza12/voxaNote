# Quick Fix: CocoaPods Manifest.lock Error

## The Problem
Xcode is looking for `Pods/Manifest.lock` but it's missing. This file is generated by `pod install`.

## The Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Install CocoaPods (if not installed)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Enter your password when prompted. Wait for installation to complete.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
pod --version
```

Should show a version number (e.g., `1.15.2`).

### Step 2: Run pod install

```bash
cd /Users/peterwylie/VoxaNote/mobile_flutter/ios
pod install
```

This will:
- Read your `Podfile`
- Download all iOS dependencies
- Create `Pods/Manifest.lock` (the missing file)
- Link everything properly

## Alternative: Use the Fix Script

I've created a script that does this automatically:

```bash
cd /Users/peterwylie/VoxaNote/mobile_flutter/ios
./fix-pods.sh
```

This script will:
- Check if CocoaPods is installed
- Clean old Pods
- Run `pod install`
- Tell you what to do next

## After pod install Completes

1. **Close Xcode completely** (if it's open)
2. **Reopen the workspace** (NOT the project):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/peterwylie/VoxaNote/mobile_flutter
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```
   ⚠️ **Important**: Open `Runner.xcworkspace`, NOT `Runner.xcodeproj`

3. **Build and run** in Xcode - the error should be gone!

## Troubleshooting

### "pod: command not found" after installation

If `pod` still isn't found:

1. **Check where it was installed:**
   ```bash
   gem which cocoapods
   ```

2. **Add to PATH** (add to `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(gem environment gemdir)/bin"
   ```

3. **Or use full path:**
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/pod install
   ```

### "Permission denied" errors

Make sure you're using `sudo`:
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Still getting errors?

Try a clean reinstall:

```bash
cd /Users/peterwylie/VoxaNote/mobile_flutter/ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
```

## What's Happening?

- **Podfile**: Lists iOS dependencies (like `package.json` for npm)
- **Podfile.lock**: Locks dependency versions
- **Pods/**: Contains the actual dependency code
- **Pods/Manifest.lock**: Xcode uses this to verify Pods are in sync

When `Manifest.lock` is missing, Xcode can't verify the Pods are installed correctly, so it fails the build.

## Quick Command Summary

```bash
# 1. Install CocoaPods (one time)
sudo gem install cocoapods

# 2. Install dependencies
cd /Users/peterwylie/VoxaNote/mobile_flutter/ios
pod install

# 3. Reopen Xcode workspace
cd ..
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

That's it! After this, your iOS build should work.
